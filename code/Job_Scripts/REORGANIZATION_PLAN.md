# Job Scripts Reorganization and Race Condition Fix Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. **CRITICAL Race Conditions** ðŸš¨
**What causes them:**
When multiple SLURM jobs complete simultaneously, they all trigger the callback mechanism at the same time. This results in multiple `enhanced_queue_manager.py` instances trying to:
- Read/write the same SQLite database (`materials.db`)
- Create workflow directories with identical timestamps
- Submit new jobs based on the same completion events
- Update the same job status files

**Files Affected:**
- `enhanced_queue_manager.py` (lines 454-487) - Multiple instances accessing database simultaneously
- `material_database.py` - SQLite write conflicts between concurrent connections
- `workflow_engine.py` (lines 151-176) - Directory creation collisions from timestamp-based naming
- SLURM script callbacks - Multiple callbacks triggering simultaneously when jobs finish

**Real-world scenario:** 
If 10 optimization jobs complete within seconds of each other, 10 callback processes start simultaneously, potentially creating 10 duplicate single-point calculations for the same material.

**Risk:** Database corruption, duplicate job submissions, workflow failures, file system conflicts

#### 2. **File Organization Issues**
**Current Problems:**
- 27 files in main directory (should be ~10-12 core files for clarity)
- Multiple versions of same functionality (4 different population scripts)
- Test/development files mixed with production code (8 test/hotfix files)
- Legacy CRYSTAL17 files intermixed with CRYSTAL23 (confusing for primary CRYSTAL23 usage)
- Documentation files scattered in main directory
- Temporary/hotfix files that have served their purpose still present

**Impact:** Difficult to find the right scripts, confusion about which version to use, maintenance complexity

## Proposed Directory Structure

### **core/** - Main Production Files (9 files)
**Purpose:** The modern enhanced workflow system (Phase 2-3 implementation)
**When to use:** Primary system for CRYSTAL23 calculations with automated workflow progression

```
core/
â”œâ”€â”€ enhanced_queue_manager.py          # Primary enhanced queue manager with material tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ material_database.py               # SQLite + ASE database engine for material lifecycle tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_engine.py                 # Orchestrates OPT â†’ SP â†’ BAND/DOSS workflow progression  
â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_planner.py                # Interactive workflow planning with CIF conversion integration
â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_executor.py               # Executes planned workflows with error handling
â”œâ”€â”€ run_workflow.py                    # Main entry point - unified interface for all workflow operations
â”œâ”€â”€ crystal_file_manager.py            # Organized file management by material ID and calculation type
â”œâ”€â”€ material_monitor.py                # Real-time monitoring dashboard and system health checks
â””â”€â”€ error_recovery.py                  # Automated error detection/recovery with YAML configuration
```

### **legacy/** - Still-Active Legacy Files (3 files)
**Purpose:** Original queue management system and simple batch submission
**When to use:** When you need simple batch job submission without the enhanced tracking, or for compatibility with existing workflows

```
legacy/
â”œâ”€â”€ crystal_queue_manager.py           # Original SLURM queue manager (JSON-based tracking)
â”œâ”€â”€ submitcrystal23.py                 # Simple batch submission of all .d12 files in directory
â””â”€â”€ submit_prop.py                     # Simple batch submission of all .d3 files in directory
```

### **slurm_scripts/** - SLURM Job Scripts (7 files)
**Purpose:** All SLURM batch script templates for job submission
**When to use:** These are called automatically by queue managers or can be used directly for manual job submission

```
slurm_scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ submitcrystal23.sh                 # Main CRYSTAL23 job script (32 cores, 7 days, optimization/SP)
â”œâ”€â”€ submit_prop.sh                     # Properties calculation script (28 cores, 1 day, post-SCF properties)
â”œâ”€â”€ submitcrystal17.sh                 # Legacy CRYSTAL17 support (for occasional use)
â””â”€â”€ workflow_scripts/                  # Workflow-specific templates (used by workflow system)
    â”œâ”€â”€ submitcrystal23_opt_1.sh       # Optimization template (step 1 in workflows)
    â”œâ”€â”€ submitcrystal23_sp_2.sh        # Single point template (step 2 in workflows)  
    â”œâ”€â”€ submit_prop_band_3.sh          # Band structure template (step 3 in workflows)
    â”œâ”€â”€ submit_prop_doss_4.sh          # DOS template (step 4 in workflows)
    â””â”€â”€ submitcrystal23_freq_5.sh      # Frequency template (step 5 in workflows)
```

**Note:** All scripts now include enhanced callback logic that checks multiple locations for queue managers.

### **config/** - Configuration Files (3 files)
**Purpose:** All YAML and JSON configuration files for system behavior
**When to modify:** When customizing error recovery strategies, workflow definitions, or saved workflow plans

```
config/
â”œâ”€â”€ recovery_config.yaml              # Error recovery strategies (SHRINK fixes, memory adjustments, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ workflows.yaml                    # Workflow definitions (OPTâ†’SPâ†’BAND/DOSS sequences)
â””â”€â”€ workflow_configs/                 # JSON workflow configurations (saved workflow plans)
```

### **utils/** - Utility Scripts (3 files)
**Purpose:** Standalone utility scripts for database management and job control
**When to use:** For database setup, job management, or navigation tasks

```
utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ populate_completed_jobs.py        # Database population from existing completed calculations
â”œâ”€â”€ cancel-jobs.sh                    # Selective job cancellation by job ID threshold
â””â”€â”€ cd_job.sh                         # Navigation utility to jump to job scratch directories
```

### **working/** - Active Workflow Data (4 items)
**Purpose:** All active calculation data and temporary processing space
**Contents:** Generated automatically by the workflow system, contains current work

```
working/
â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_inputs/                   # Step-by-step input file organization
â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_outputs/                 # Individual calculation folders with results
â”œâ”€â”€ materials.db                      # SQLite material database (tracks all calculations)
â””â”€â”€ temp/                             # Temporary processing space (cleaned periodically)
    â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_staging/              # Temporary staging for file generation
    â””â”€â”€ workflow_temp/                 # Temporary workspace for script execution
```

**Important:** This directory contains active work - do not manually delete files here.

### **Archived/** - Obsolete Files (12 files)
**Purpose:** Files that are no longer actively used but kept for reference or occasional use
**Access:** Only access when you need legacy functionality or reference material

```
Archived/
â”œâ”€â”€ crystal17/                        # Legacy CRYSTAL17 (keep since occasionally used)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ submitcrystal17.py            # CRYSTAL17 batch submission
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ submit_prop_17.py             # CRYSTAL17 properties batch submission  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ submit_prop_17.sh             # CRYSTAL17 properties SLURM script
â”œâ”€â”€ old_versions/                     # Obsolete script versions (historical reference)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ populate_completed_jobs_fixed.py    # Fixed version (logic now in canonical version)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ populate_database_with_completed.py # Alternative implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ quick_populate_fix.py              # Quick patch version
â”œâ”€â”€ testing/                          # Development/test files (preserved for regression testing)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_integration.py           # Comprehensive Phase 1 integration tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_phase2_integration.py    # Phase 2 integration tests with realistic scenarios
â””â”€â”€ documentation/                    # Old documentation (historical reference)
    â”œâ”€â”€ CALLBACK_FIXES_README.md      # Historical callback fix documentation
    â””â”€â”€ WORKFLOW_MANAGER_README.md     # Old workflow documentation (superseded by main README.md)
```

### **DELETE** - Obsolete Development Files (7 files)
**Purpose:** These files served temporary purposes during development and are no longer needed
**Reason for deletion:** Functionality has been integrated into main code or fixes have been applied

```
Files to Delete:
â”œâ”€â”€ test_callback_fix.py              # One-time debugging script for specific callback bugs (issues resolved)
â”œâ”€â”€ test_callback_integration.py      # Development verification script (functionality now stable)
â”œâ”€â”€ callback_hotfix.py                # Hotfix for method name mismatches (fixes integrated into main code)
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy_fixed_files.sh             # Temporary deployment script for hotfixes (deployment complete)
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy_fixes.py                   # Python deployment tool for hotfixes (deployment complete)
â”œâ”€â”€ quick_fix.sh                      # Quick deployment script (deployment complete)
â””â”€â”€ copy_dependencies.py              # Appears to be temporary utility (unknown current purpose)
```

**CRITICAL - DO NOT DELETE:**
- `error_detector.py` - **ESSENTIAL DEPENDENCY** used by `error_recovery.py` and `material_monitor.py`

**Safe to delete because:**
- Hotfixes have been applied to the main codebase
- Test scripts were for specific bugs that are now resolved
- Deployment scripts were for one-time deployment tasks
- copy_dependencies.py appears to be a utility script with no core dependencies found

## Population Scripts Consolidation

### **Current State (4 versions exist):**
- `populate_completed_jobs.py` - Original version (KEEP as canonical)
- `populate_completed_jobs_fixed.py` - Fixed version with proper method calls (ARCHIVE)
- `populate_database_with_completed.py` - Alternative implementation (ARCHIVE)
- `quick_populate_fix.py` - Quick patch version (ARCHIVE)

### **Recommendation:**
Keep `populate_completed_jobs.py` as the canonical version since:
- This is the original/primary version that should remain the standard
- Archive the other versions as historical alternatives
- If fixes are needed, they should be applied to the canonical version rather than maintaining multiple versions

## Race Condition Fixes Required

### **1. Enhanced Queue Manager - Distributed Locking**

**File:** `enhanced_queue_manager.py`
**Problem:** Multiple instances can simultaneously read/write database
**Fix:** Add file-based distributed locking

```python
import fcntl
from contextlib import contextmanager

class EnhancedQueueManager:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.global_lock_file = Path.cwd() / ".enhanced_queue_manager.lock"
        
    @contextmanager
    def _global_queue_lock(self):
        """Prevents multiple queue manager instances from running simultaneously"""
        lock_file = None
        try:
            lock_file = open(self.global_lock_file, 'w')
            fcntl.flock(lock_file.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)
            yield
        except BlockingIOError:
            print(f"Another queue manager instance is running (PID file: {self.global_lock_file})")
            return
        finally:
            if lock_file:
                fcntl.flock(lock_file.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN)
                lock_file.close()
                
    def check_queue_status(self):
        with self._global_queue_lock():
            # Existing queue checking logic
            pass
```

### **2. Material Database - WAL Mode and Connection Pooling**

**File:** `material_database.py`  
**Problem:** SQLite write conflicts under concurrent access
**Fix:** Enable WAL mode and add connection timeouts

```python
def _get_connection(self):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(
        str(self.db_path),
        timeout=60.0,
        check_same_thread=False
    )
    # Enable Write-Ahead Logging for better concurrency
    conn.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")
    conn.execute("PRAGMA busy_timeout=30000")  # 30 second timeout
    conn.execute("PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL")   # Balance performance/safety
    return conn
```

### **3. Workflow Engine - Unique Directory Generation**

**File:** `workflow_engine.py`
**Problem:** Timestamp collisions in directory creation
**Fix:** Add UUID for uniqueness

```python
import uuid

def create_isolated_calculation_directory(self, material_id, calc_type):
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    unique_id = str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]  # Short UUID for uniqueness
    calc_dir_name = f"{material_id}_{calc_type}_{timestamp}_{unique_id}"
    # Rest of directory creation logic...
```

### **4. SLURM Callback Race Conditions**

**Files:** All workflow SLURM scripts
**Problem:** Multiple job completions triggering simultaneous callbacks
**Fix:** Add randomized delay before callback

```bash
# Add to end of all SLURM scripts before callback:
RANDOM_DELAY=$((RANDOM % 30 + 10))  # Random delay 10-40 seconds
sleep $RANDOM_DELAY

# Existing callback logic...
if [ -f $DIR/enhanced_queue_manager.py ]; then
    cd $DIR
    python enhanced_queue_manager.py --max-jobs 250 --reserve 30 --max-submit 5 --callback-mode completion
# ... rest of callback logic
fi
```

## Additional Critical Issues Beyond Race Conditions

### **SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**

#### **1. Command Injection Risk**
**File:** `enhanced_queue_manager.py` (line 408)
```python
cmd = [submit_script, input_file.name]  # User-controlled filename
result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
```
**Risk:** Malicious filenames could execute arbitrary commands
**Fix:** Input validation and sanitization required

#### **2. SQL Injection Potential** 
**File:** `material_database.py` (lines 375-377)
```python
cursor = conn.execute(f"SELECT * FROM calculations{where_clause} ORDER BY created_at DESC", params)
```
**Risk:** Dynamic SQL construction with user input
**Fix:** Parameterized queries and input validation

#### **3. Path Traversal Vulnerabilities**
**Files:** Multiple files using `Path(user_input)` without validation
**Risk:** Access to files outside intended directories via `../../../` attacks
**Fix:** Path validation and sandboxing

### **RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES** ðŸ”´ **HIGH PRIORITY**

#### **1. Database Connection Leaks**
**File:** `material_database.py` (line 182-195)
**Issue:** Database connections not properly closed in exception paths
**Risk:** Connection pool exhaustion over time
**Fix:** Implement proper context managers and connection pooling

#### **2. Memory Leaks**
**File:** `workflow_engine.py` (lines 243-321)
**Issue:** Large files copied to temporary directories, cleanup may fail
**Risk:** Disk space exhaustion over time
**Fix:** Guaranteed cleanup with proper try/finally blocks

#### **3. File Handle Leaks**
**Files:** `crystal_file_manager.py`, `error_recovery.py`
**Issue:** File operations without proper `with` statements in some paths
**Risk:** File descriptor exhaustion
**Fix:** Consistent use of context managers

### **SCALABILITY BOTTLENECKS** ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### **1. Inefficient Database Queries**
**File:** `material_database.py` (lines 423-429)
```python
def get_all_calculations(self) -> List[Dict]:
    cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM calculations ORDER BY created_at DESC")
```
**Issue:** No LIMIT clause on potentially large result sets
**Risk:** Memory exhaustion with large databases
**Fix:** Add pagination and query limits

#### **2. O(nÂ²) Material Matching Algorithm**
**File:** `material_database.py` (lines 697-725)
**Issue:** Nested loops for material similarity matching
**Risk:** Performance degradation with many materials
**Fix:** Implement more efficient matching algorithms

### **CONFIGURATION HARDCODING** ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### **1. Hardcoded Directory Paths**
**File:** `workflow_engine.py` (lines 77-81)
```python
script_paths[key] = base_path / "Crystal_To_CIF" / script_name
script_paths[key] = base_path / "Creation_Scripts" / script_name
```
**Issue:** Hardcoded directory structure
**Risk:** Breaks when deployed in different environments
**Fix:** Configuration file for all paths

#### **2. Hardcoded Resource Limits**
**File:** `enhanced_queue_manager.py` (lines 72-74)
**Issue:** No configuration file support for limits and timeouts
**Risk:** Cannot adapt to different cluster configurations  
**Fix:** YAML configuration for all parameters

## Risk Assessment

### **Current Risks (Before Fixes)**
- ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: Database corruption from concurrent writes
- ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: Duplicate job submissions from race conditions  
- ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: Workflow failures from directory conflicts
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: File organization confusion

### **Risks After Implementation**
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW**: Occasional callback delays (10-40 seconds)
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW**: Temporary performance impact from locking
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Import path updates required for existing workflows

## Validation Testing Plan

### **Concurrent Access Tests**
```bash
# Test 1: Multiple queue managers
python enhanced_queue_manager.py --callback-mode completion &
python enhanced_queue_manager.py --callback-mode completion &  
python enhanced_queue_manager.py --callback-mode completion &

# Test 2: Database stress test
for i in {1..10}; do
    python populate_completed_jobs.py &
done

# Test 3: Workflow progression with high job completion rate
# Submit 50 jobs and monitor for duplicates
```

### **Expected Outcomes**
- âœ… Only one queue manager instance should run at a time
- âœ… Database should remain consistent with concurrent access
- âœ… No duplicate workflow steps should be generated
- âœ… All callbacks should execute without conflicts

## Rollback Plan

### **If Issues Arise:**
1. **Revert to Previous State**: Git branch with all changes for easy rollback
2. **Database Backup**: Backup materials.db before implementing changes
3. **Script Backup**: Preserve original scripts in temporary backup folder
4. **Gradual Implementation**: Implement fixes one at a time, test each

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. âœ… Implement race condition fixes
2. âœ… Create new directory structure
3. âœ… Move files to appropriate locations
4. âœ… Test concurrent access scenarios
5. âœ… Update documentation

**Do you want me to proceed with:**
- [ ] Race condition fixes first (most critical)
- [ ] File reorganization first (easier to test)
- [ ] Both simultaneously
- [ ] Create a test branch first

**Confirmation needed for:**
- [ ] Delete the 8 obsolete development files listed above
- [ ] Archive CRYSTAL17 files (since occasionally used) 
- [ ] Keep `populate_completed_jobs_fixed.py` as canonical version
- [ ] Proceed with directory reorganization as outlined
