## Scripts Kept (Actively Used)

The following scripts were verified to be in active use and were NOT moved:

1. **dat_file_processor.py**
   - Used by crystal_property_extractor.py for processing BAND.DAT and DOSS.DAT files
   - Provides essential DAT file analysis functionality

2. **population_analysis_processor.py**
   - Used by crystal_property_extractor.py for Mulliken population analysis
   - Critical for population analysis extraction

3. **advanced_electronic_analyzer.py**
   - Used by crystal_property_extractor.py for advanced electronic structure analysis
   - Provides sophisticated DOS/BAND analysis

## Updates Made

### copy_dependencies.py
- Removed references to archived scripts:
  - `property_analysis_framework.py`
  - `additional_properties_analyzer.py`
- Kept references to actively used scripts

## Verification

All moves were verified:
- 4 scripts successfully moved to Archived/
- 3 critical scripts remain in place
- copy_dependencies.py updated to reflect current state

## Next Steps

Consider further cleanup:
1. Review other potentially unused scripts mentioned in the analysis
2. Update documentation to reflect current workflow architecture
3. Consider creating a `legacy/` directory for Crystal17-related scripts
