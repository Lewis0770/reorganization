# Quick Answers to Your Questions

## 1. Will the fixes ensure correct calculations use the JSON files?

**YES** - The workflow executor properly uses the JSON configuration files:

- Expert mode configurations are saved to JSON files during planning (e.g., `/workflow_temp/expert_config_opt/opt_expert_config.json`)
- During execution, these JSON files are passed to CRYSTALOptToD12.py via `--options-file`
- The workflow executor checks for `crystal_opt_config` in the step configuration and uses it

Example from your workflow plan:
```json
"OPT2_2": {
  "expert_mode": true,
  "options_file": "/mnt/ffs24/home/djokicma/test2/workflow_temp/expert_config_opt/opt_expert_config.json",
  "crystal_opt_config": {
    "functional": "B3LYP",
    "dispersion": true,
    "tolerances": {"TOLINTEG": "7 7 7 7 14", "TOLDEE": 7},
    ...
  }
}
```

## 2. Is effective mass calculation part of standard advanced_electronic_analyzer?

**YES** - It's already integrated:

- `crystal_property_extractor.py` imports and uses `AdvancedElectronicAnalyzer` (line 1548)
- When BAND/DOSS files are found, it automatically runs advanced analysis
- Real effective masses are calculated from band curvature
- Properties stored include:
  - `electron_effective_mass_real`
  - `hole_effective_mass_real`
  - `electron_mobility_calculated`
  - `hole_mobility_calculated`

The `update_effective_masses.py` script was just a utility to retroactively update existing calculations - it's not needed for new workflows.

## 3. Files Cleaned Up

## Summary

✅ The workflow fixes ensure proper sequence execution (OPT → OPT2 → SP + OPT3)
✅ JSON configurations are properly used for expert mode calculations
✅ Effective mass calculations are already integrated in the standard workflow
✅ All redundant files have been archived
