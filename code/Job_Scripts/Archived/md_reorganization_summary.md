# Markdown Files Reorganization Summary

## Date: June 27, 2025

## What Was Done:

### 1. Merged Key Information into README.md
Added new section "External Dependencies and Integration" containing:
- List of external scripts used (NewCifToD12.py, CRYSTALOptToD12.py, etc.)
- Script location resolution details
- Configuration file information (recovery_config.yaml active, workflows.yaml not used)

### 2. Archived Development/Analysis Documents
Moved 9 markdown files to Archived/:
- archive_summary_20250627.md - Today's archiving activities
- duplicate_functions_analysis.md - Analysis of code duplication
- script_usage_verification.md - Script usage verification
- workflow_consolidation_guide.md - Future consolidation guide
- workflow_refactoring_plan.md - Comprehensive refactoring plan
- workflow_robustness_report.md - Robustness analysis
- workflow_dependencies_analysis.md - Dependency analysis (info extracted to README)
- yaml_files_analysis.md - YAML file analysis (info extracted to README)
- md_files_reorganization_plan.md - This reorganization plan

### 3. Result
- Main directory now contains only README.md - the comprehensive system documentation
- All development artifacts preserved in Archived/ for reference
- README.md enhanced with previously missing dependency and configuration information

## Benefits:
1. Cleaner main directory focused on user-facing documentation
2. Preserved development history and analysis documents
3. More comprehensive README.md with all essential information
4. Clear separation between operational docs and development artifacts
