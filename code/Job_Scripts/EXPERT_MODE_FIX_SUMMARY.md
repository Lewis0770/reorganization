# Expert Mode Fix Summary

## Problem
The expert mode for SP and other calculations (OPT2, FREQ) was not working correctly. When users selected expert mode (level 3), the system would defer the interactive configuration to the execution phase, but at that point the required scripts (CRYSTALOptToD12.py) weren't available, causing the configuration to fail.

## Root Cause
The workflow planner was saving a flag to run CRYSTALOptToD12.py interactively later during execution, instead of running it immediately during the planning phase when the scripts were available.

## Solution
Modified the workflow planner to:

1. **Copy required scripts early** when expert mode is selected
2. **Run CRYSTALOptToD12.py interactively during planning** (not execution)
3. **Save the configuration** from the interactive session
4. **Use the saved configuration during execution** without requiring further interaction

## Changes Made

### 1. workflow_planner.py

#### Added new helper methods:
- `_copy_required_scripts_for_expert_mode()`: Copies CRYSTALOptToD12.py and dependencies early
- `_run_interactive_crystal_opt_config()`: Runs CRYSTALOptToD12.py interactively and saves config

#### Modified expert configuration methods:
- `_get_expert_sp_config()`: Now runs interactive configuration immediately
- `_get_expert_opt_config()`: Now runs interactive configuration immediately
- `configure_frequency_step()`: Expert mode now runs interactive configuration immediately

### 2. workflow_executor.py

#### Modified execution handling:
- `run_crystal_opt_conversion()`: Now checks for saved expert configuration first
- Uses `--options-file` instead of `--config-file` (correct argument for CRYSTALOptToD12.py)
- Properly handles the saved configuration without running interactively again

## Usage Flow

### Before Fix:
1. User selects expert mode during planning
2. System saves flag to run interactively later
3. During execution, CRYSTALOptToD12.py not found
4. Configuration fails

### After Fix:
1. User selects expert mode during planning
2. System copies required scripts immediately
3. CRYSTALOptToD12.py runs interactively NOW
4. Configuration is saved to JSON file
5. During execution, saved config is used (no interaction needed)

## Benefits

1. **Interactive configuration happens at the right time** - during planning when user is actively configuring the workflow
2. **No surprises during execution** - all configuration is complete before jobs start
3. **Reproducible workflows** - saved configurations can be reused
4. **Better user experience** - clear separation between planning and execution phases

## Example Expert SP Configuration

When user selects expert mode for SP:

```python
# During planning phase:
1. Scripts are copied to working directory
2. CRYSTALOptToD12.py launches interactively
3. User configures all SP settings (basis, SCF, etc.)
4. Configuration saved to JSON:
   {
     "calculation_type": "SP",
     "inherit_geometry": true,
     "new_basis": "def2-TZVP",
     "scf_settings": {...}
   }

# During execution phase:
1. Saved configuration is loaded
2. CRYSTALOptToD12.py runs with --options-file
3. SP input files generated automatically
4. No user interaction required
```

## Testing

Created `test_expert_mode_fix.py` to verify:
- Scripts are copied correctly
- Configuration structure is proper
- Execution phase uses saved config
- No interactive prompts during execution

All tests pass successfully!
