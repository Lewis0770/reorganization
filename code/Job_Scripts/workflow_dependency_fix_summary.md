# Workflow Engine Dependency Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed the workflow engine to properly handle parallel execution with correct dependencies in CRYSTAL calculations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `_get_next_steps_from_sequence` Method
- **Location**: `workflow_engine.py` lines 1218-1282
- **Changes**:
  - Added `completed_calc_type` parameter to understand what just completed
  - Implemented proper dependency logic:
    - OPT completion triggers: SP and FREQ (in parallel)
    - SP completion triggers: BAND, DOSS, and subsequent OPT (e.g., OPT2)
    - FREQ depends only on OPT (not SP)
    - Subsequent OPTs (OPT2, OPT3) depend on the previous SP
  - Now scans the entire sequence to find all calculations that can start

### 2. Added `_check_and_trigger_pending_calculations` Method
- **Location**: `workflow_engine.py` lines 1060-1152
- **Purpose**: Checks for and triggers any calculations that should have been started but haven't yet
- **Features**:
  - Handles cases where workflow steps might have been missed
  - Ensures all parallel calculations are triggered
  - Respects dependency rules

### 3. Updated `execute_workflow_step` Method
- **Changes**:
  - Updated calls to `_get_next_steps_from_sequence` to pass `calc_type`
  - Added FREQ generation in parallel with SP after OPT completion (default behavior)
  - Fixed FREQ numbering (FREQ2, FREQ3, etc.) to use `generate_numbered_calculation`
  - Added call to `_check_and_trigger_pending_calculations` to catch any missed steps

## Dependency Rules Implemented

```
OPT ─────┬──→ SP ─────┬──→ BAND
         │            ├──→ DOSS
         └──→ FREQ    └──→ OPT2 ─────┬──→ SP2 ─────┬──→ BAND2
                                     │             ├──→ DOSS2
                                     └──→ FREQ2    └──→ OPT3
```

### Rules:
1. **OPT → SP + FREQ**: When OPT completes, both SP and FREQ can start in parallel
2. **SP → BAND + DOSS + OPTn+1**: When SP completes, BAND, DOSS, and the next OPT can start
3. **FREQ Independence**: FREQ calculations depend only on their corresponding OPT, not on SP
4. **Sequential OPTs**: OPT2 depends on SP (not SP2), OPT3 depends on SP2, etc.

## Benefits

1. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple calculations can now run simultaneously when dependencies are met
2. **Correct Dependencies**: FREQ no longer waits for SP unnecessarily
3. **Workflow Recovery**: Can detect and trigger missed calculations
4. **Numbered Calculations**: Properly handles OPT2, SP2, FREQ2, etc.

## Testing

Created `test_workflow_dependencies.py` which verifies:
- Dependency logic for various completion scenarios
- Parallel calculation triggering
- Complex workflows with multiple optimization cycles

All dependency logic tests pass successfully.

## Usage

The workflow engine will now automatically:
1. Trigger SP and FREQ in parallel after OPT completion
2. Trigger BAND, DOSS, and OPT2 in parallel after SP completion
3. Handle complex workflows like: OPT → SP → OPT2 → SP2 → OPT3
4. Recover from incomplete workflow executions
