# Material Tracking System Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a pragmatic, incremental approach to implement a centralized material tracking system for CRYSTAL quantum chemistry workflows. The strategy focuses on enhancing existing tools rather than rebuilding from scratch, ensuring backward compatibility and minimizing implementation risk.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Centralized Material Tracking**: Maintain complete history of calculations, geometries, and properties for each material
2. **Automated Error Recovery**: Detect and automatically fix common CRYSTAL calculation errors
3. **Workflow Automation**: Seamlessly progress materials through calculation sequences (OPT → SP → BAND/DOS)
4. **Property Integration**: Automatically extract and store material properties as calculations complete
5. **Resource Optimization**: Intelligent queue management and resource allocation

### Success Metrics
- 90% reduction in manual job monitoring time
- 75% reduction in failed job recovery time
- 100% retention of calculation history and provenance
- Zero data loss during system operation
- Maintain compatibility with all existing scripts
